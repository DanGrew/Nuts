# Nuts
Nutrient Usage Tracking System

I've been spending a lot of time working hard to lose weight and through lots of research and video watching, listening to the experts, I've moved on to macro counting. Part of this has involved calculations and planning and I felt there should be an easy (and free!) way of doing all this day to day. So here's Nuts!

# Goals

I've put in the calculation for your base maintenance calories and a few options surrounding that. This is to avoid need to go online, find the calculation, grab a pen and paper and crunching numbers. I've tried to leave it open so you can adjust an part of it as you go along. Calculators do not work the same for everyone! You have to tweak it based on how your body responds.

Here's a screen shot for what the goals tab looks like.
