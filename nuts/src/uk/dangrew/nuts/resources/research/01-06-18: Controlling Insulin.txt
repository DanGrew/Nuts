[s][20][b]Controlling Insulin
[s]

[i]
Insulin is a bit too technical for me, I don't think I'm that interested in all of the detail... I’m just going to eat healthy regular meals through the day, and I’ll eat less to get my body to store less fat. That seems simple to me and it really makes sense for the body. I'm not significantly overweight and have no problems with diabetes - the impact of insulin seems irrelevant to me, not something for me to worry about…

This was definitely me in 2017, and let me start by saying this isn’t a horrible perspective - it’s definitely common and understandable. However… is it optimal for achieving my goals? far from it.

It’s difficult researching nutrition, so many different perspectives and contradicting points. There’s always the worry you are going to hurt yourself. Let me say this though, when you understand what sugar does to your body and how much you’ve been consuming all your life, there’s not much more damage you can really worry about! Anyhow…. insulin is not too technical; it’s like anything, you can dive as deep as you want into the detail (and I still don’t know it all!). The important part for me, for us, is that insulin is a hormone that tells your body to store fat and this is a one way operation, you cannot burn fat and store fat at the same time. So how is this relevant? Well of course we want to burn fat, so we do not want to store fat, therefore we need to avoid insulin for this purpose. Now let’s not get crazy… the body is a clever biological machine and insulin is extremely important for a number of reasons, not just managing fat, so cutting it out is not a healthy option - we just want to control it a little better. 

This is a good point to refer to Dr Jason Fung’s compartmental model with an analogy for a fridge/freezer:

Your body can only handle about 5g of sugar in the bloodstream at any given time, more than this can make you unwell and extreme cases can kill you. Your body is clever, when it detects more sugar than it needs (and since we’re all friends here, let’s use sugar and glucose interchangeably!) it releases insulin to pull the sugar out of the bloodstream. This is good, it gets rid of the health risk but also the body creates energy stores for us in the liver and in our muscles - this is a great use for glucose. However, when we have too much, the body has to do something with it, and part of that answer is to convert it to fat and store it. So hopefully you see, insulin is not an enemy - it keeps you alive! - but we can store fat if we are eating the wrong things.

It’s not just sugar that insulin responds to, it can be any form of food, drinks, calories. Different foods affect insulin differently - carbohydrates that will get converted into glucose will spike insulin levels significantly (I won’t go on a sugar rant, that’s for another article), protein will spike insulin but to a much lesser degree, and fat barely touches insulin. Side thought: is keto making a little more sense now? So what can I do, everything spikes insulin! Well, water doesn’t, so yes drink plenty of water… sorry, I know, not very appealing, we’ll come on to this later though. Anyway, now we know this, it should be clear - when you consume something, you can spike insulin and therefore you can stop fat burning. Not good for our goals really… So there’s the next aspect to question, am I achieving anything eating regularly through the day? Well, logic would have it, every time you eat you will trigger insulin and therefore stop fat burning. Me personally, I want to be fat burning as much as possible to get rid of it and so this really does suggest eating less doesn’t it? Or does it? Actually, it means, eating less often, [t-c][blue][b]not calorie reduction, calorie distribution.[t-c][n]

Now I haven’t spoken about calories or restriction deliberately… because to a large extent it doesn’t matter! Yes… I’m one of those revolutionists that believe eating more doesn’t alone cause you to gain fat. This is a big puzzle - maybe even a game - with lots of pieces and strategies. I think this, the controlling of insulin, is the most important and that provides possibly the most reward for the effort you put in.

[b]Further thinking...

[t-c][green][n]What happens if we don’t control insulin properly? 
What happens if we abuse sugar and spike insulin regularly and significantly?...
[t-c][n]Well… I consider you read my article on Insulin Resistance. (coming soon)

[t-c][green][n]I’m sold on inulin management, so how do I control it? 
I like eating? 
[t-c][n]I found a few different ways of managing my diet and food to support this, check out my article on Intermittent Fasting. (coming soon)
